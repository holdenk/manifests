# Running the tests

To run the tests with you can call the `scripts/run-tests.sh` script which enables go modules and run `make test`.

# Unit Test design

The unit tests encode the expected output as files and then diffing the output.
The unit tests are autogenerated by the Makefile with `make generate`.
For this to work your checkout must be in a directory named `manifests`.
